If all the original text in the dataset is in the same language, then mul should not be used.Example: Consider a dataset from a multilingual country like Switzerland, with the original stops.stop_name field populated with stop names in different languages. Each stop name is written according to the dominant language in that stop’s geographic location, e.g. Genève for the French-speaking city of Geneva, Zürich for the German-speaking city of Zurich, and Biel/Bienne for the bilingual city of Biel/Bienne. The dataset feed_lang should be mul and translations would be provided in translations.txt, in German: Genf, Zürich and Biel; in French: Genève, Zurich and Bienne; in Italian: Ginevra, Zurigo and Bienna; and in English: Geneva, Zurich and Biel/Bienne."
