# Timetable Editing Simplification Plan

## Overview
Simplify the timetable editing system by removing complex change tracking and making all edits direct to the database. This eliminates the disconnect between internal state and global unsaved changes tracking.

## Core Changes
- **Direct database edits**: All changes save immediately to database
- **Remove change tracking**: No more internal edit state management
- **Always-on editing**: Remove editing mode toggle and controls
- **Simplified UI**: Clean up editing controls and indicators

- Removed 3 internal helper methods: `updateTimeInternal()`, `updateArrivalDepartureTimeInternal()`, and `skipStopInternal()` (all were placeholder methods)
- Code reduction: Eliminated approximately 40+ lines of internal helper code and simplified the main update methods

**Result:** Database update methods now operate with a clean validation â†’ database update â†’ feedback flow, removing all intermediate state management and undo tracking complexity.

## ðŸš¨ Critical Issue Discovered: Skip Functionality Architecture Problem

**Issue**: The current skip/unskip implementation is fundamentally incorrect:

### Current (Incorrect) Approach:
- `skipStop()`: Sets `time = null` in existing `stop_time` records
- `unskipStop()`: Sets `time = "00:00:00"` in existing `stop_time` records
- UI uses `isSkipped` boolean flag (always `false`) to detect skipped stops

### Correct GTFS Approach:
- **Skip**: A stop is skipped when there is **NO `stop_time` record** for that trip/stop combination
- **Unskip**: Create a new `stop_time` record for the trip/stop combination
- **UI Detection**: A stop is skipped if no `stop_time` record exists for the trip/stop

### Required Changes:
1. **`skipStop()`**: Delete the `stop_time` record entirely (`database.deleteRow()`)
2. **`unskipStop()`**: Create a new `stop_time` record (`database.insertRow()`)
3. **Data Generation**: Detect missing `stop_time` records as skipped stops, set `isSkipped: true`
4. **UI Logic**: Handle cases where no `stop_time` exists for a trip/stop combination
5. **Database Methods**: Ensure `deleteRow()` and `insertRow()` methods are available

### Impact:
- Skip functionality is currently broken and doesn't follow GTFS standards
- This needs to be addressed in a future phase focusing on database operations

### 8.1 Manual testing checklist
- [ ] Test time editing in both single and arrival/departure modes
- [ ] Test navigation between timetables without unsaved changes warnings
- [ ] Test skip/unskip functionality
- [ ] Test keyboard navigation
- [ ] Test error handling for invalid time formats
- [ ] Test large timetables for performance

### 8.2 UI/UX improvements
- [ ] Add loading indicators during database updates
- [ ] Improve error messages for failed updates
- [ ] Add success feedback for completed edits
- [ ] Ensure responsive design for mobile editing

## Expected Benefits

âœ… **Simplified codebase**: Remove ~500 lines of complex change tracking code
âœ… **No more inconsistent state**: Direct database edits eliminate sync issues
âœ… **Better user experience**: Immediate saves, no confusing "unsaved changes"
âœ… **Easier maintenance**: Less complex state management
âœ… **Better reliability**: Direct database operations are more predictable

## Implementation Notes

- **Preserve data integrity**: All database operations should be atomic
- **Maintain validation**: Keep client-side validation before database updates
- **Keep performance**: Maintain virtual scrolling and efficient rendering
- **Backward compatibility**: Ensure existing GTFS files continue to work
- **Error recovery**: Provide clear feedback when operations fail
